                        Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander.
                        I'm here to put you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they
                        can. Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. I tell you, this station will be operational as
                        planned.

                All right, move it! I said move it! Go on! Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Bring those two down here!
                Let's go! Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? Freeze! Don't move! We surrender.
                No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics.

                <br> Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. The code's changed. We need Artoo! Here's the terminal. Artoo, where are you? We
                need you at the bunker right away. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?
